For this blog post, I originally wanted to talk about something that pissed me off today. I called a couple of my friends and ranted, I have a silent but quite annoying temper at times. I decided to take a walk instead of a run after work to clear my head. On my walks, I always make sure to go on the [Ã¥rstabroarna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85rstabroarna) which looks over the newly built area of Marievik. I saw the most beautiful sunset with fantastic towers overlooking the river. I knew I wanted to talk about something positive.

I think this will be a good first post.

What do I wish the world was like? I want it to be more honest, brave, less angry, and more accepting. It's something everyone says, but I don't believe people know how bad it is. My boss (I mean the CEO proper btw, not my manager) was both a coward and a liar today, I didn't care what was said. I cared why she did it. 

I guess I can say I do not believe in what I do. Every company has a mission, but how many companies have employees that believe in that mission? So let me tell you what I believe, what I want, and what I hope to work on!

I believe in Utopia, I believe I can build Utopia. I do not think it's possible to achieve Utopia, but we get closer to it every day through technology. We are closer to Utopia today than our grandparents were, and they were closer to Utopia than their grandparents. Let me show you what Utopia looks like:

![cyborg](https://github.com/21st-centuryman/21st-centuryman.github.io/blob/main/images/cyborg_hand.gif?raw=true)
![disease](https://github.com/21st-centuryman/21st-centuryman.github.io/blob/main/images/smallpox_news.png?raw=true)
![futurism](https://github.com/21st-centuryman/21st-centuryman.github.io/blob/main/images/retrofuturism.jpg?raw=true)

In my generation there are things we can achieve, to go towards this goal:

* Limitless energy, with nuclear fusion, and fission. I am all for decentralization through solar panels, but there is only one good option.
* Make the world disease-free, instead of treating our permanent diseases with temporary solutions (medicine), we can instead genetically engineer our body to be resistant to bacteria. After all, this is what vaccines do.
* Improve ourselves with artificial intelligence that mentors us, and helps us become the person we want to become. The age of distraction, the age of porn, the age of satisfaction, and mindless scrolling might soon be over.
* Produce everything using 3D printers and computer-aided design, ChatGPT can already generate OpenSCAD code for you, the next step is just allowing more to be produced with 3D printers.
* Make everything dirt cheap by importing asteroids with more material than we could ever ask for. Imagine a world where gold and iron are as cheap as paper. All products would only cost only what it costs to manufacture + a small markup. The material cost could be 0.

Do I want to work with this? YES!

Do I think my current place of work does this? NO!

I am not sure if I am unhappy with my work. I guess I have a dire need to have a mission to follow, and a purpose to my work. 

I have a purpose in my personal life. I believe I am living with the girl of my life, whom I want to marry someday. I will be proud of my children, That part of my life will be good. I guess I am too philosophical for my own good. I blame my dad for this, always being so political (love you, Dad). I need a purpose for that other part of life, in my work.

I do not care about money. I care about building something that matters. 

There are ways to be moral in the world. A moral lawyer will try to decrease the number of laws, a greedy one wants to increase it. A moral engineer will build something that helps, a greedy one will just build for those who have the highest bidder. I want to be moral.

I realize I come across as a "nobody understands me" kind of guy. Besides being cringy af, I guess this is my way of therapy. Life can be rough, maybe the way to solve this is by just doing something. Maybe a leap of faith is all that's needed. Everything happens for a reason, I do believe that. 

Maybe, the only way of making sure that the stuff that matters is built is by starting it yourself.

Building Towards Utopia.
