INTRO ABOUT THE SIMULATION


What's kinda interesting is that we are all wondering what the meaning of our reality, however in digital realities we do not have this issue. Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley are a celebration on consumerism, basically acumulate capital to buy certain items; Telltale and Naughty Dog games are about the story; I guess Grand Theft Auto games are about freedom or a lack of responsibilities and accountability. There is clearly a lot of similarities between this and how many see their lives.

There are plenty of people who think that the accumulation of capital to be the goal. These are the kind of people whom commit suicide [when the market goes south](https://financialpost.com/business-insider/why-high-finance-workers-commit-suicide). If a number change in a database leads to your untimely demise, its kinda pathetic.

Then there are also those who believe the cycle life and death is beautiful. If heat death of the universe is not preventable, then this is clearly the right answer. It is also the most boring option. I want to have kids and have a traditional life, however I also want to live forever with my kids, for them to remain 25 for eternity and explore the stars.

A much more optimistic and glorious path is that of the Science Victory in Civilization V and VI (I have not played the other games).
