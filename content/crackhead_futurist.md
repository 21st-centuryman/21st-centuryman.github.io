Between my days at high school and university, I took a gap year in London. I’ve realized I miss one thing about London. The neighborhood crackheads. 

Every big city has a crackheads in the major neighborhoods. Currently, I live in Midsommarkransen in Stockholm. All my neighborhood crackhead tells me is to “make a name for myself and jump onto the metro tracks”. I’m going to be honest, that doesn’t hit the same as the crackheads in London telling me and everyone else at the station: “I will kill you all one day”.

I was a waiter in London, working mainly odd hours. 4-13 or 18-2. When you hear that someone will kill you at 4 in the morning, it wakes you up more than the strongest cocaine you could ever use (I’m an anti-drug dude btw, never done cocaine in my life). 

However, I have realized something after reading the Elon Musk book by Walter Isaacson. If you want to build the future you need this energy. 

So let me introduce you to my new firm

Crackhead futurist inc.

We care about the future. 

We are driven.

We are not crazy.

We will never stop at anything to build the future we want.

I would love to work 8 to 24  on something I love. My current employer does not give me this. Can you? 

If not should I start my own firm? I’m not sure if I can do that in Sweden. I am not allowed to fire anyone I want here. Can we build the future with such an idiotic law?

I remember at the beginning of my time at KTH, we were introduced to the Engineering Union of Sweden. Their representative told us “Sweden has the most patents per capita after Switzerland”. Is that something to brag about?

Parents are nothing more than a legal document saying “Hey I want credit for an invention”. Sweden doesn’t innovate, or at least I don’t get a feeling that the future is being built here. To be honest, I don't feel that all of Europe innovates. The United States is building rockets and creating the AI we are dependent on. Patents don’t indicate that society is building tech that goes from zero to one.

We need more crackhead futurist inc everywhere. This is not a Swedish issue. This is a humanity issue.

The one thing I can say about Elon that got from that book is that Man is thinking about humanity, he does not care about nations, politics, or regulation. Despite being a massive asshole, at least he gets it done.

When I was 8 Thomas Edison was my hero. I knew from day one what I wanted to become. An Inventor. 

I even promised my friend I would build him a lightsaber. I don’t talk to this friend anymore, but I intend to keep that promise. I am therefore asking myself if regulations are the reason I am not building or maybe it is just the excuse I am using for not building something that matters. To be honest, I am writing this post drunk instead of building something that matters.

 I’m reminded of a tweet I saw recently on X.

> It's crazy that to create any high-level tech in the world of atoms, the hardest part is simply getting permits, insurance, and the bullshit paperwork together to have the right to build.
There has to be a better way.

> True, but also true that e/acc is about embracing the pain and doing what it takes.

Maybe we should build the future no matter the barriers to entry.

Maybe that’s what it means to build crackhead futurist Inc.
