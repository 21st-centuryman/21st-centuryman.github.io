This is my script for a presentation I plan to hold at the KTH AI Society in Stockholm, Sweden. Enjoy.

To understand the implications of Artificial intelligence we need to discuss the following periods:

* Where did we come from?
* Where are we now?
* Where could we be going?

# Where did we come from?

I guess I should start at the beginning, the very beginning. The universe could easily be understood as a transition of entropy from a low to a high state. The Big Bang was the ultimate low entropy state, and heat death is the ultimate high entropy state. We are very lucky to exist in such a chaotic and fantastic part of the universe. All the interesting shit is now. 

So if everything in the universe is energy what does that make us? Our matter is energy, all the stuff we love, heat, food, and "vibes" is energy. We are heat-seeking beings, all animals are simply energy-seeking objects, a natural consequence of this chaotic energetic period we live in. But if you think about this progress, Artificial intelligence is just the natural evolution of this idea. If we are going to have beings smart enough of course they would create a "helper" to capture more energy. This is what automation is or, what all machines are, they convert energy to something, which could be a car, a number, or a thought. It is kinda funny how we always seem discontent with the current state of things, but I assume that's the natural consequence of having an energy-seeking mind, the goalpost is always moving. But what do we do with this information, ie what is the goal of this energy seeking?

# Where are we now?

We are currently in a very stagnant situation in the West. Below I have a graph of the energy consumption in Sweden over time.

You might interject with arguments of climate change activism and that we do not have enough energy to sustain all humans on earth. With that in mind let me quickly make some points and continue with my thesis.

We have plenty of resources for everyone, if everyone was as efficient as US farmers at farming, we would have enough food for [20 billion people](https://youtu.be/4xkXjj6dalM?si=Nsy75H2CTRJQAyhD&t=314). We could easily become a zero-carbon society if we did nuclear. Sweden has six nuclear plants, and that is the share of the production. We do not need many more nuclear plants to make the non-eco-friendly parts disappear. The issue is not a lack of resources, the problem is the barriers to economic development. Now let us focus on the issue ahead.

The reason why you live a better life than your grandparents is because you are able to consume more energy than they were. The more energy you can consume the more you can focus on specialization, the fact we have supermarkets should shock you. We still have plenty of work to do, there are plenty of issues to solve. We need to make this line go up.

We have people today arguing that we need to decrease the line, all that will do is make us unable to reach a life rid of diseases, of instant travel, and a more fulfilled life. I am not trying to sell you utopianism here, I do not believe in it. However, I think we can all agree that whatever utopia means, we are closer to it today than our grandparents were, or at least I think so. 

# Where could we be going?

We have vaccines that actually solve medicine, medicine's goal is to cure all diseases, and vaccines do this. Why would you ever want to decrease this progress? 

I want to be able to see my kids more (I do not have children btw) by making travel between countries easier, faster AND cheaper. Why would I want to decrease this progress?

If you make something cheaper or make an individual more efficient, it is the same as them getting a salary increase, they can all of the sudden by or use more with less. This is the fundamental idea of capitalism.

It is really important we make this line to go up. This is how we make the world better, how we go zero to one, how we make sure our kids have a better future. Of course, we need this energy to be green as well, oil will run out. However, we need this to occur without making the world worse to live in. We could have energy at 1 Ã¶re per kW hour, instead, we need to worry if hospitals have enough energy.

This is where we as engineers come in.

So what can you do about this, how can AI help you?

I want to introduce you to E/Acc the least ideological ideology on this planet, it has three basic beliefs:

1. You believe the world gets better through technological innovation
2. You believe you can contribute to technological innovation.
3. You should therefore build the future.

Basically, I am telling you to build what you think is right, and push through the regulation if you have to, the future is too important.

Think about something like medicine or biotech. What is the goal of these fields? To cure all diseases! So why can't we use AI to mass produce genes for genetic engineering so we can change our software to make us all able to not get sick? Who cares about the negative consequences of genetic engineering, a cure for all diseases that also allows us to make superhumans is a tradeoff I would make. 

Engineers are not responsible for the negative consequences of their technology. Oppenheimer made a hammer, he made a tool. He did not use the bomb, the US military did. If the positive implications are big enough you have to do it. You can make AI mentors that make every person their ideal version of themselves, Make an AI that helps you improve 3d printers for mass consumption, Yes this can make someone with bad intentiosn competent, or make an machine that can build whatever horrors some sicko can imagine. If it is a trade you would do you need to build it. I believe the vst majority of people have good intentions, and I trust this progress. You should to.

There are plenty of other applications, this is simply what I mentioned right now.

Basically, AI is the tool you can use to make you superhuman; LLMs are mainly for the normie population, but you can use it to build something that matters and can make society closer to utopia. 

So build cool shit, you are morally obligated to.
